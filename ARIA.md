# ARIA, Accessibility
## If possible please follow those:
- Add enough color contrast. (https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html)
- Don’t use color alone to make critical information understandable. Try to use an indicator other than color such as text labels or patterns. When showing errors on the screen, don’t rely on colored text alone, add an icon or include a title to the message. (https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html)
- Design usable focus states. Browsers, by default, use a CSS pseudo class to show these outlines on elements when they’re selected. If you get rid of this default style, be sure to replace it with something else. (https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-visible.html)
- Use labels or instructions with form fields and inputs. The <label> elements are read for each form control. Any non-label text, as placeholder text, is usually skipped over. (https://webaim.org/techniques/forms/)
- Write useful alternative text for your images and other non-text content. (https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H37.html)
- Use correct markup on your content. (https://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/)
- Support keyboard navigation. Keyboard accessibility is one of the most critical aspects of web accessibility. (https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation-keyboard-operable.html)
